# AI-Based House Price Prediction Using Economic and Social Indicators

This project implements a machine learning–based system to predict house prices by combining traditional property features with economic and social indicators.

## Features Used
- Property features: Square feet, BHK, bathrooms, parking, year built, location
- Economic & social indicators: GDP growth, inflation rate, crime rate, city development index

## Algorithms Used
- Linear Regression (baseline)
- Random Forest Regression (final optimized model with GridSearchCV)

## Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Joblib

## Model Evaluation
- Metrics: MAE, RMSE, R² Score
- R² achieved: ~0.94
- Visualizations: Correlation heatmap, feature importance, actual vs predicted plot
